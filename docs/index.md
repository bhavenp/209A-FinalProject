This website describes the process we went through to analyze loans offered by Lending Club and build models to predict which loans would default. We used the outputs of these models to achieve an above average return on investment, while remaining socially conscious that we were not discriminating against individuals of a specific socio-economic status. 

Enjoy!

We are looking for seed funding to begin the implementation of our investment strategy.
